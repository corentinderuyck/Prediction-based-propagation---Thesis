 * A set variable is a variable that represents a set of integers from an original universe set.
 * Its domain is conceptually represented by:
 * - a set of included integers I
 * - a set of possible integers P
 * - a set of excluded integers S
 * I,P and S are disjoint sets and their union is the universe of the set variable.
 * In addition, a cardinality variable represents the cardinality of the set
 * The variable is considered fixed when the set of possible integers is empty.
 * At this point, the cardinality variable is equal to the size of the set of included integers.
